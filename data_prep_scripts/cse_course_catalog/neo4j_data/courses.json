Typically, the primary target population is individuals with strokes, spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injuries, and other injuries that inhibit daily activities. However, it could also target sports medicine, military, and entertainment applications. This course is an introductory design course in Neurobotics focusing on learning about human neural control of movement, using physiological signals as inputs, and controlling a mechanical device. Students will learn simple control laws, hands on experience and programming in controlling robots, and applying knowledge of human movements to move the robot. There is a design project competition at the end of quarter.",

Other intellectual property areas that may be covered, time permitting, include copyright, trademark, and trade secret law. Where possible, the course will also endeavor to balance the discussion of practical legal considerations with broader policy questions (e.g., should certain subject matter be off limits for patenting?, the relationship between innovation and IP, approaches to patent reform, etc.).

This overarching project spans hardware (optics, displays, electronics, and microcontrollers) and software (JavaScript, WebGL, and GLSL). Each assignment will build toward this larger goal. For example, in one assignment, students will learn to use an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to track the position of the headset. In another assignment, students will apply real-time computer graphics methods to correct lens distortions. Lectures will complement these engineering projects, diving into the history of AR/VR and relevant topics in computer graphics, signal processing, and human perception. Guest speakers will participate from leading AR/VR companies and academic institutions.",
